How to Compile:
This project contains 3 folders: Feature Extraction, Model Building, and Result. 

1. mlproj_features.py
This file contains code for feature extraction. To run it, type python mlproj_features.py in the terminal. After execution, copy and replace the train and test files generated to the Model Building folder.

2. mlproj_models.py
This file contains code for model building and outcome prediction. To run it, type python mlproj_models.py in the terminal.

If feature extraction file is not run, model building can still be tested as we have provided the train and test files containing the extracted features in the model building folder.

3. The Result folder contains the sampleSubmission that shows the format in which the result is expected and the actual result file named 'submission' that contains the output predicted by mlproj_models.py
